### Research Question:
* How do rising interest rates disproportionately affect African countries, and what policy measures can mitigate these challenges?
* This study examines the factors contributing to the high debt-servicing burdens faced by African nations and evaluates potential policy solutions, such as interest rate reductions and debt restructuring, to address these challenges.

### Approach and codings

First, we check the external debt in African countries to see the current situation with static plots, and then compare interest-to-GNI for African data with other representative emerging and Non-African (all countries except for Africa) markets to see the potential factors that hinder the African economic development by calculating a weighted average of interest payment to consider the difference of credit risk.

We retrieve from the International Debt Statistics and create a chart comparing annual borrowing (Disbursements) with annual repayments of principal and Interest Payment. Additionally, we calculated Net Borrowing (funds available for development). 

Then, we created the shiny app to see the overall trend. Due to the technical error between Altair and shiny in our laptop system, we used Matplotlib. With a checkbox, you can choose Africa, Asia and South America markets, and overall Non-African market. The alphabetic credit ratings were converted to numbers, decreasing from a good rating (A) to a lower rating (C), ranging from 21 to 0. Plus, with a switch, you can compare individual countryâ€™s data for interest-to-GNI over time as a supplement for the static plot.

### Data Sources:
* World Bank Databank (World Development Indicators): Data on debt-to-GNI ratios, interest payments.
* Credit Rating Data: Average credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies. These ratings were quantified and obtained through internal access at the UNDP.
* International Debt Statistics: Supplementary data on external debt and repayment.

### Findings
1. Static Plot

* Debt Landscape (2012-2022)

Annual borrowing in Africa (~$80 billion) is largely offset by repayments, limiting net financing for development.

* Interest Payments on External Debt (2022):

Mozambique (13.9%) has experienced the heaviest burdens. Namibia and Libya lack data and are excluded from the plot to avoid the impact of imputing missing values.

2. Dynamic Analysis (Shiny App)

* Weighted Average Interest Rates

African countries face a higher average (1.85%) compared to Asian countries (1.53%).

* Credit Rating Comparison: 

Within the same credit ratings, African countries consistently pay higher interest rates. For instance, BB-rated African countries face rates near 3%, compared to just over 1% for non-African peers.

### Policy Recommendations
* Rate Reductions: Alleviate financial burdens and allow reallocation of funds toward infrastructure and economic development.
* Targeted Support: IOs should prioritize Africa in their debt relief initiatives. 

### Challenges
* Data Availability: Inconsistent macro economic data across African countries.
* Analytical Complexity: Difficulty in isolating the effects of external factors, such as commodity price fluctuations and geopolitical issues.

### Future Research
* Investigate the relationship between governance indicators and debt-servicing outcomes.
* Conduct case studies on successful debt restructuring in Africa.
* Expand the analysis to include other regions for comparative insights.
